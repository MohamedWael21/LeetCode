# 🧩 LeetCode Daily Progress

This repository is my growing archive of LeetCode solutions.  
Each problem I solve gets its own numbered directory, counting upward from `000`.  
The numbering reflects exactly how many problems have been completed so far.

## 📁 Structure

- Directories are named using a **three-digit incremental index**:
  - `000`, `001`, `002`, `003`, ...
- Inside each directory is **one C++ file** which is **LeetCode problem name**:
  - `name of problem.cpp`
- A new problem is added **every day** as part of my ongoing practice.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Track my long-term daily problem-solving streak
- Keep solutions cleanly organized and easy to navigate
- Build a clear timeline of progress, day by day
